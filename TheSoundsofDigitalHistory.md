When reading “[Big Data for Dead People: Digital Readings and the Conundrums of Positivism][bddp]” by Tim Hitchcock, the author made reference to a project called [Virtual St. Paul’s Cathedral Project][vspcp]. The project enables the listener to experience public worship and preaching at St. Paul’s Cathedral and in Paul’s Churchyard on particular occasions in early seventeenth century  London. Using architectural modeling software and acoustic simulation software, the project is able to recreate these important moments of the past, like John Donne’s sermon delivered November 5th, 1622 and Easter Sunday 1624 with a sermon by Bishop Lancelot Andrewes.

From this article, an [annotation][ann1] by *breanneneudorf* brought up an interesting point about how speech creates a greater impact on the brain than text or images; essentially the affects of [radio versus TV][rvtv]. When subjects were shown information, the TV had the best immediate recall but the radio had a longer recall and subjects were able to remember information for hours afterwards. With radio, as with books, listeners are able to create their own interpretations of the information and paint their own images, allowing them to relate to the sounds on a personal level. 

Another [annotation][ann2] by *Ktamg* mentions how the St. Paul’s Cathedral Project is a great alternative to experiencing history because it focuses on using different sensory means, not just reading text. In the article, written by Adrienne Lafrance titled “[Hearing the Lost Sounds of Antiquity][hlsa]”, the author begins by mentioning how history has been portrayed for years through paintings, sculptures, text, and objects, yet only recently -within the last 160 years- has recorded sound offered insight into the past. Thanks to modern technology we are able to look at ancient structures and study the space, trying to make sense of why builders and architects designed the structures the way they did; what kind of atmosphere were they trying to achieve.

It would be interesting to see how the affects of speech play an important part in designing modern buildings and structures to achieve nearly perfect acoustics. For instance, long before the time of PA systems, Greek theatres of ancient antiquity -like that of the [Greek Theatre of Epidaurus][gte]- were able to effectively transmit voices and melodies from theatrical and music performances to large audiences in rows reaching nearly 60 metres away. It would be beneficial for engineers to study these ancient structures when conceiving modern day concert halls and stadiums because looking to the past could provide answers to questions in the future.
