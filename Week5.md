HIST3814o- Fail Log for Week 5


I am currently researching ideas on how I would like to display the information for my final project. I haven't been able to come up with an idea thus far on how I would like to examine my data of The Shawville Equity newspaper. 

# Module 4
Reading through Module 4, I have picked out a few Exercises which seem most germane for my final project. I plan to tackle these Exercises once I have a clear idea of which exercises I plan to use in my final project. I will attempt the following exercises to see whether I like the outcomes of how the data is presented.  

- Exercise 4: Text Analysis with Overview
- Exercise 5: Corpus Linguistics with AntConc
- Exercise 8: Simple Mapping and Georectifying
- Exercise 10: QGIS

FAIL: I had a minor setback this week due to VERY minimal internet connection. I'm talking like sitting in the middle of the woods having to hotspot from a cell phone... the internet cafe in town really let me down. Therefore I've spent the last few days catching up on previous exercises and readings. However, I remain optimistic that I will complete my final project on time. 

I will continue to research more projects today for inspiration and organize my approach (I do this often before tackling a final essay or report).
