HIST3814o- Fail Log for Week 5


I am currently researching ideas on how I would like to display the information for my final project. I haven't been able to come up with an idea thus far on how I would like to examine my data of The Shawville Equity newspaper. 

# Module 4
Reading through Module 4, I have picked out a few Exercises which seem most germane to my final project. I plan to tackle these Exercises once I have a clear idea of which techniques I plan to use in my final project. I will attempt the following exercises to see whether I like the outcomes of how the data is presented.  

- Exercise 4: Text Analysis with Overview
- Exercise 5: Corpus Linguistics with AntConc
- Exercise 8: Simple Mapping and Georectifying
- Exercise 10: QGIS

FAIL: I had a minor setback this week due to VERY minimal internet connection. I'm talking like sitting in the middle of the woods having to hotspot from a cell phone... the internet cafe in town really let me down. Therefore I've spent the last few days catching up on previous exercises and readings. However, I remain optimistic that I will complete my final project on time. 

I will continue to research more projects today for inspiration and organize my approach (I do this often before tackling a final essay or report). 

### Exercise 4: Text Analysis with Overview.
##### What I did
Overview looks at word frequencies and their distributions within a document, and within a corpus, to organize the documents into folders of progressively similar word use.

- I downloaded [Overview][overview]
- I watched the video, created an account, and then logged in
- I clicked 'import from a CSV file', and uploaded the CND.csv which I had saved on my computer. Then hit 'upload'
- I explored the Overview system that allowed me to view the frequencies of several words throughout the document. I liked the appearence of the program and how the most common words were the largest. 
- I then uploaded my cleaned-correspondance.csv file to explore that in Overview


- FAIL: I noticed that when I attempted to upload the cleaned-correspondance.csv file, I was recieving some errors. The file type must be '.csv' and text must be separated with commas. Apparently my data wasn't completely "cleaned", in otherwords, it was MESSY still. So I opened the file in excel and cleaned it up more. 
- CORRECTION: I tried again to upload the new cleaned file and it worked, HOORAY! I explored the Overview system again.

### Extra: Story Map.
##### What I did
- I also tried another mappying program that Dr. Graham suggested called [StoryMapJS][sm]
- StoryMapJS is a free tool to help you tell stories on the web that highlight the locations of a series of events. It is a new tool, yet stable in our development environment, and it has a friendly authoring tool.
- I explored the program and experimented with the tools to see how it worked. I liked the concept of it and it helped me to develop some ideas for my final project. I like how it provides an interactive way to display information with the assistance of a map.
